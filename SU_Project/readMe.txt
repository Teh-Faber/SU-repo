You navigate through the menus be entering the desired number and pressing enter. Whenever the terminal promts you to press enter tor continue. It will ignore all other keypresses, even if the terminal displays them. 

In this iteration Dungeons have been added where each dungeon can have multiples of the same enemy.

The heros HP restores after every fight.

If your hero dies they are dead FOREVER. Luckily you can always make a new hero or load an existing one through the menu.

Game data is autosaved when switching heros or exiting the game. So if you're losing a fight you can always close the game and it will open to the latest autosave.
