The Game uses QSQLite as to handle the database so make sure to have it installed.

You navigate through the menus be entering the desired number and pressing enter. 

Whenever the terminal promts you to press enter to continue. It will ignore all other keypresses, even if the terminal displays them. 

In this iteration Magic and an Element system has been added. 

Elements modify the damage taken by each enemy, who each have elemenets assign to them. 
The terminal will tell you if your attack is less or more effective.

Magic can be bought from the shop and will be kept in the heros inventory. 
New heros have nothing so they will have to go ask the nice shopkeeper for a spare knife.

The heros HP and Mana restores after every fight. 
(You're lucky i've went easy on you) // Hardcore DLC coming SOON^TM

If your hero dies they are dead FOREVER. Luckily you can always make a new hero or load an existing one through the menu.

The items is not saved in the database immediately similar to level and xp.
Game data is ONLY autosaved when switching heros or exiting the game. 
So if you're losing a fight you can always close the game and it will open to the latest autosave.
